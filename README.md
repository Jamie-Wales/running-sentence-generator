# running-sentence-generator
## The brief was the following
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. I created a running generator. I set the different sentence structures up in an object, in an array I then created a getter to generate a random setence using a helper function that generated a random number based on the array length and log to console.

Great project from code academy really enjoyed sinking my teeth into something where I was free to build how I wished.
